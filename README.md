# Fred Metabolism

 This is my edit of kamelzarandah edit of spaghetti_metabolismo made by Malik. In this edit you will be able to create consumables. Each one can affect player cores, increasing stamina or health and even overpowers (gold cores). You have some items created as an example. This script works with spaghetti_hud, i added it in case you don't have it i also renamed it to make some functions work properly. This is a script for RedM and VORP framework.


# TODO: 

- [ ] Add animations. 
- [x] Config.lua file for easy configuration.
